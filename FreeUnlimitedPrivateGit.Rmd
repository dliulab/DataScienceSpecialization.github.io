## Overview

[GitHub](https://github.com/) gives you unlimited *public* space for free. What if you have a private project, you don't really want to or it is not an option for you to put that source code in a public GitHub? I am going to tell you that you can have unlimited *private* Git space too. Except the space is going to come from the Microsoft, and not from the GitHub.com.

You might ask: *Do I have to use Visual Studio to get free unlimited private Git space?* **NO!**

Here are the steps:

1. Sign up for a free [Visual Studio Online](https://www.visualstudio.com) account.

* Click on the green button under the "Visual Studio Online" text.
